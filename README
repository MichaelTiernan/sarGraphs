Version Requirements:

  sysstat-7.x
  php-5.x
  php-gd-5.x
  jpgraph-3.5

Installation: 

 * Be sure you have sysstat installed and running. As this is intially a Redhat package version 7 of sysstat will
   be required (this is the current version of sysstat on RHEL5). There may be plans for future release to support
   addtional versions of sysstat.
  
 * Get the latest sarGraphs source from https://github.com/jness/sarGraphs.

 * In order for sarGraphs to function JpGraphs needs to be installed. This software can be downloaded 
   from http://jpgraph.net/download/ (Version used for testing was jpgraph-3.5.0b1.tar.gz), or an RPM
   can be found at http://flip-edesign.com/sarGraphs/source/Redhat/. You will also want to review the
   JpGraph QPL License http://www.opensource.org/licenses/qtpl.php as it uses a differnt license then
   sarGraphs.

   Once the PHP Library has been extracted to the location of your choice, you will need to modify
   sarGraphs/includes/jpgraph_dir.php and place in the path to your JpGraph src directory.

 * Clone or extract the sarGraphs source to a Web readable location (example would be /var/www/html/sarGraphs/).

 * Be sure this path allows override (to run .htaccess files).

 * Test the application is working properly, if working you will notice in the graphs/ & raw/ directories:
         As root run: ./cron.sh 

 * Verify the data is available via the web, password can be found (and changed) in sarGraphs_1.1.0/password_file.php
         http://example.com/sarGraphs (This would be the path you created)

 * Create a new crontab for root as below (runs hourly)
         10 * * * * /PATH TO DATA/graphs/cron.sh 2>&  (Add in the correct paths)
