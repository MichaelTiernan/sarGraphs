Installation: 
  
  * Get the latest sarGraphs source from https://github.com/jness/sarGraphs.

  * In order for sarGraphs to function JpGraphs needs to be installed. This software can be downloaded from
   http://jpgraph.net/download/ (Version used for testing was jpgraph-3.5.0b1.tar.gz).

    Once the PHP Library has been extracted to the location of your choice, you will need to modify
    sarGraphs/includes/jpgraph_dir.php and place in the path to your JpGraph src directory.

  * Clone or extract the sarGraphs source to a Web readable location (example would be /var/www/html/sarGraphs/).

  * Be sure this path allows override (to run .htaccess files).

  * Test the application is working properly, if working you will notice in the graphs/ & raw/ directories:
         As root run: ./cron.sh 

  * Verify the data is available via the web, password can be found (and changed) in sarGraphs_1.1.0/password_file.php
         http://example.com/sarGraphs (This would be the path you created)

  * Create a new crontab for root as below (runs hourly)
           10 * * * * /PATH TO DATA/graphs/cron.sh 2>&  (Add in the correct paths)
