Installation: 

 * Be sure you have sysstat installed and running. 

   As this software was intially created for Redhat, sysstat package version 
   5.x - 7.x will be required (sysstat 8.1.5 modified how Swap is reported). 
   There may be plans for future release to support addtional versions of sysstat.
  
 * Get the latest sarGraphs source from https://github.com/jness/sarGraphs.

 * Clone or extract the sarGraphs source to a Web readable location, or a install directory of your choice.

   An example Apache configuration would look similar to below:

   Alias /sarGraphs /usr/share/sarGraphs/
   <Directory "/usr/share/sarGraphs/">	
	AllowOverride All
   </Directory>

 * Be sure this path allows override (to run .htaccess files).

 * Test the application is working properly by running ./cron.sh as root. 
   If working, you will notice in the graphs/ & raw/ directories are populated with data:

 * Verify the data is available via the web, password can be found (and changed) in sarGraphs_1.1.0/password_file.php
         http://example.com/sarGraphs (This would be the path you created)

 * Create a new crontab for root as below (runs hourly)
         10 * * * * /usr/share/sarGraphs/cron.sh 2>&  (Add in the correct paths)
